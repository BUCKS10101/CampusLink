# CampusLink  


Problem

It’s 11 PM, and hunger strikes.

One Food has Spicy Zinger.

Walking all the way? Too far. Starving? Too painful.

 Solutions

CampusLink makes food delivery hyperlocal by connecting students with… other students.

No long Swiggy wait times.

No “Bro, please this last time” guilt trips.

Just peer-to-peer delivery within campus.

How It Works

Craving strikes → Open CampusLink.

See who’s nearby (One Food, DC Cafe, food trucks, etc.).

Place your order, pay, and relax.

Your peer brings food straight to your hostel → instant happiness.

 Why CampusLink?

Cheaper than outside apps (no crazy delivery fees).

Campus-only → safe, fast, and relatable.

Built for students → helping each other survive hostel life.
